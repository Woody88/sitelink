All processing goes through the full backend → container → queue pipeline, making it impossible to:\n1. Quickly test detection on a PDF\n2. Generate debug/annotated images locally\n3. Compare detection results with mobile rendering\n4. Iterate on coordinate transformations\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Must Have\n1. **CLI command** to process a PDF and output:\n   - Annotated debug image (like `callouts_annotated.png`)\n   - JSON with detected markers and normalized coordinates\n   - Sheet metadata (dimensions, rotation applied)\n\n2. **Matching settings** with production:\n   - Same DPI (300)\n   - Same rotation handling (apply PDF /Rotate)\n   - Same coordinate normalization\n\n3. **PMTiles generation** option:\n   - Generate tiles from the same image\n   - Allow visual verification of marker positioning\n\n### Nice to Have\n1. **Side-by-side comparison tool** - show mobile screenshot vs debug image\n2. **Coordinate calculator** - input normalized coords, show pixel positions\n\n---\n\n## Approach Options\n\n### Option A: Port to monorepo (Recommended)\nCreate `packages/callout-processor/` in main sitelink repo:\n- Port code from `sitelink_backend-dev/packages/callout-processor`\n- Ensure it uses same detection logic as `apps/backend/container/server.py`\n- Add as workspace package for import by backend\n\n**Pros:**\n- Single source of truth\n- Easy to keep in sync\n- Can be imported by container\n\n**Cons:**\n- Migration effort\n\n### Option B: Shared package via npm/git\nPublish callout-processor as npm package or git submodule\n\n**Pros:**\n- Clear separation\n- Can version independently\n\n**Cons:**\n- Sync overhead\n- Two places to update\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Can run `bun callout:detect --pdf apps/sample-plan.pdf --output ./output`\n- [ ] Outputs annotated PNG with rectangles around detected callouts\n- [ ] Outputs JSON with markers matching production format\n- [ ] Uses same DPI/rotation settings as production backend\n- [ ] Can optionally generate PMTiles for verification\n\n---\n\n## Files to Reference\n\n**Source (backend-dev):**\n- `packages/callout-processor/src/index.ts` - CLI entry point\n- `packages/callout-processor/src/services/cvLLMDetection.ts` - Detection logic\n- `packages/callout-processor/src/services/annotateImage.py` - Debug image generation\n\n**Production (main repo):**\n- `apps/backend/container/server.py` - Current detection implementation\n- `apps/backend/container/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-15T17:30:40.426575435-05:00","created_by":"woodson","updated_at":"2026-01-15T19:22:36.043712001-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-15T19:22:36.043712001-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented local callout processor package at packages/callout-processor/ with CLI: bun callout:detect --pdf \u003cpath\u003e --output \u003cdir\u003e.

OR the callout processor used the hardcoded 2550×3300 fallback\n3. The mobile app received data from a DIFFERENT processing run at 5100×3300\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Need to trace what dimensions the ACTUAL callout detection used when processing the mobile data\n2. Verify if markers were normalized against 2550×3300 or 5100×3300\n3.

This causes:\n1. X-axis shift (if width differs)\n2. Y-axis shift (if height differs)  \n3. Complete positional mismatch when both differ\n\n### Key Question to Answer\n\nWhat dimensions did the backend use when it emitted the `sheetCalloutsDetected` event that populated the mobile database?

PMTiles library can extract tiles from a .pmtiles file\n2. OpenSeadragon can display those tiles via custom tile source\n3. The integration pattern works before adding React Native complexity\n\n## Setup\n```bash\nmkdir pmtiles-osd-spike \u0026\u0026 cd pmtiles-osd-spike\nbun init\nbun add openseadragon pmtiles react react-dom\nbun add -d vite @vitejs/plugin-react\n```\n\n## Test Plan\n\n### 1. Generate a test PMTiles file\nUse VIPS pipeline on a sample construction plan:\n```bash\n# Convert PDF/image to tiles\nvips dzsave sample-plan.jpg tmp_tiles --layout google --suffix \".webp[Q=75]\"\n\n# Pack with ZYX scheme (fixes axis flip)\nmb-util tmp_tiles/ plan.mbtiles --scheme=zyx --image_format=webp\n\n# Convert to PMTiles\npmtiles convert plan.mbtiles plan.pmtiles\n```\n\n### 2. Create custom OpenSeadragon TileSource\nOverride tile loading to fetch from PMTiles:\n- Use pmtiles.getZxy(level, x, y) to get tile data\n- Convert to blob URL or base64\n- Feed to OpenSeadragon\n\n### 3. Verify in browser\n- Tiles load correctly at all zoom levels\n- Pan/zoom is smooth\n- No coordinate axis issues (plan not mirrored/flipped)\n- Memory usage is reasonable\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] PMTiles file loads without errors\n- [ ] OpenSeadragon displays the plan correctly\n- [ ] Zoom levels work (tiles switch appropriately)\n- [ ] Plan orientation is correct (not flipped)\n- [ ] Document the working pattern for mobile integration\n\n## Notes\n- If downloadTileStart does not work reliably, try imageLoader.addJob override pattern from old_docs-2.md\n- PMTiles uses ZXY coordinates - verify alignment with OpenSeadragon expectations\n- This spike informs the mobile implementation approach","notes":"## ✅ Integration Verified\n\nSuccessfully demonstrated PMTiles + OpenSeadragon integration!\n\n### What Works\n- ✅ PMTiles file generation at 300 DPI (one-pass pipeline)\n- ✅ OpenSeadragon loads and displays tiles correctly\n- ✅ imageLoader.addJob override pattern works\n- ✅ Tiles fetched via pmtiles.getZxy(z, x, y)\n- ✅ Converted to blob URLs and displayed\n- ✅ Smooth pan and zoom functionality\n- ✅ No coordinate axis issues (ZYX scheme correct)\n\n### Pipeline (Optimized)\n```bash\n# One-pass: PDF → DZI tiles at 300 DPI\nvips dzsave \"plan.pdf[dpi=300]\" tmp_tiles --layout google --suffix \".webp[Q=75]\"\n\n# Pack to MBTiles with ZYX scheme\n../mbutil_zyx/mb-util-zyx tmp_tiles/ plan.mbtiles --scheme=zyx --image_format=webp\n\n# Convert to PMTiles\npmtiles convert plan.mbtiles plan.pmtiles\n```\n\n### File Size\nTest plan (letter-size PDF at 300 DPI): **245KB** PMTiles file\n\n### Key Learnings\n1. **One-pass is better**: No need for intermediate PNG - VIPS can render PDF and tile in one operation\n2. **DPI matters**: Initial test at low DPI was blurry - 300 DPI produces sharp, readable plans\n3. **ZYX scheme essential**: Prevents axis flip/mirroring issues\n4. **imageLoader override works perfectly**: Clean interception of tile requests\n\n### Ready for Mobile Integration\nThe pattern is proven and ready to implement in React Native with:\n- Native Actions pattern (fetch tiles in RN, pass base64 to WebView)\n- Local PMTiles file access\n- Progressive loading (fallback → tiled)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-05T18:05:20.342362401-05:00","created_by":"woodson","updated_at":"2026-01-06T00:00:29.140923443-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-06T00:00:29.140923443-05:00","close_reason":"✅ Spike successful - PMTiles + OpenSeadragon integration confirmed working.\n\nVerified:\n- PMTiles file generation at 300 DPI (one-pass pipeline)\n- OpenSeadragon loads and displays tiles correctly\n- imageLoader.addJob override pattern works\n- Tiles fetched via pmtiles.getZxy(z, x, y) and converted to blob URLs\n- Smooth pan/zoom, no coordinate issues\n- 245KB PMTiles file for letter-size plan\n\nPipeline optimized to single pass:\nvips dzsave 'plan.pdf[dpi=300]' tmp_tiles --layout google --suffix \".webp[Q=75]\"\n\nReady for mobile integration with Native Actions pattern (React Native fetches tiles, passes base64 to WebView).\n\nApp: apps/pmtiles-spike/\nCommits: ab89fb31b, 9dc97c129"}

{"id":"sitelink-4xi","title":"Plan Upload UX Overhaul: Filename-based folders + async processing feedback","description":"## Problem\n\nCurrently when uploading a plan PDF:\n1. **Folder naming is wrong**: Sheets are grouped into folders by 'discipline' (Architectural, Structural, Unfiled sheets) instead of by the original PDF filename\n2. **No async feedback**: User sees 'Uploading Plan' modal that blocks until processing completes, instead of async background processing with visual feedback\n3. **Sheet viewer needs verification**: Ensure clicking sheets shows plan with callout markers\n\n## Current Architecture\n\nThe backend pipeline is already async (4 stages: image gen → metadata → callouts → tiles), but the mobile UI doesn't reflect this properly.\n\n### Current folder logic (use-sheets.ts):\n```typescript\nconst discipline = sheet.discipline || 'Unfiled sheets'\ngroupedByDiscipline[discipline].push(sheet)\n```\n\n### What we need:\n```typescript\nconst folderName = sheet.planName || 'Unknown Plan' // Original PDF filename without extension\ngroupedByPlan[folderName].push(sheet)\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n### 1. Folder Structure Change\n- Folder name = original PDF filename (without .pdf extension)\n- All sheets from that plan go into that folder\n- E.g., 'sample-plan.pdf' → folder named 'sample-plan' containing A1, Sheet 2, Sheet 3, etc.\n\n### 2. Async Upload UX\n- **Immediate**: Create folder with processing indicator (spinner icon OR animated border showing progress)\n- **Background**: Processing continues in backend\n- **Completion**: Remove processing indicator, show final sheet count\n- **Error handling**: Show error state if processing fails\n\n### 3. Sheet Viewer Verification\n- Tapping a sheet opens the plan viewer\n- Callout markers display at correct positions\n- Markers are interactive (tap to see details)\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Data Model Changes\n1. Add `planName` field to plans table (stores original filename)\n2. Update `planUploaded` event to include filename\n3. Update materializer to store planName\n4. Ensure sheets have reference to their parent plan's name\n\n### Phase 2: Folder Display Changes\n1. Update `use-sheets.ts` to group by planName instead of discipline\n2. Update `plan-selector.tsx` to display plan-based folders\n3. Add processing state indicator to folder UI\n\n### Phase 3: Upload UX Changes\n1. Update `use-plan-upload.ts` to emit event immediately with planName\n2. Add `processingStatus` field to plans (pending/processing/completed/failed)\n3. Create animated folder component with progress indicator\n4. Update UI to show processing state per-plan\n\n### Phase 4: Sheet Viewer Verification\n1. Test marker display on uploaded sheets\n2. Verify marker coordinates are correct\n3. Test marker interaction (tap → detail sheet)\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `packages/domain/src/events.ts` - Add planName to events\n- `packages/domain/src/tables.ts` - Add planName, processingStatus to plans\n- `packages/domain/src/materializers.ts` - Store planName and status\n- `apps/mobile/hooks/use-sheets.ts` - Group by planName\n- `apps/mobile/hooks/use-plan-upload.ts` - Pass filename, track status\n- `apps/mobile/components/plans/plan-selector.tsx` - Show processing state\n- `apps/mobile/components/plans/folder-item.tsx` (new) - Animated processing folder\n- `apps/backend/src/processing/queue-consumer.ts` - Emit status events","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-14T18:45:33.130283937-05:00","created_by":"woodson","updated_at":"2026-01-14T19:38:42.569277619-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-14T19:38:42.569277619-05:00","close_reason":"Plan Upload UX Overhaul complete: Implemented filename-based folders, async processing feedback with animated indicators, and verified sheet viewer marker display"}

Currently mobile processes PDFs locally and never sends to backend. Need to:\n1. Upload PDFs to backend R2\n2. Show real-time processing progress via LiveStore sync\n3. Build professional callout review UI\n\n## IMPORTANT: Agent Instructions\n\n**Always use specialized sub-agents for complex tasks:**\n- Use `subagent_type=Explore` for codebase exploration\n- Use `subagent_type=unit-testing:test-automator` for testing\n- Use MCP Maestro (`mcp__maestro__*`) tools to take screenshots and verify UI on device\n- Run the app on iOS simulator and use Maestro to interact and capture screenshots\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n**Backend (✅ Ready):**\n- POST /api/plans/upload endpoint implemented\n- 4-stage queue pipeline: images → metadata → callouts → tiles\n- LiveStore events emitted at each stage\n- WebSocket sync working\n\n**Mobile (❌ Disconnected):**\n- Processes PDFs locally, never calls backend\n- Plan status UI is hardcoded, not from LiveStore\n- No background upload queue\n- No callout review screen\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n### 1. Backend Upload Integration\n- [ ] Call POST /api/plans/upload with PDF file and auth token\n- [ ] Handle upload progress, errors, offline state\n- [ ] Remove local PDF processing from use-plan-upload.ts\n- [ ] Commit optimistic planUploaded event locally\n- [ ] **Use Maestro to screenshot upload flow**\n\n### 2. Real-time Processing Status\n- [ ] Subscribe to tables.plans.findById(planId) from LiveStore\n- [ ] Map backend stages to UI: images → metadata → callouts → tiles → complete\n- [ ] Show current stage with subtle progress animation\n- [ ] Display sheet count progress (e.g., \"Processing 2/6 sheets\")\n- [ ] **Use Maestro to screenshot each processing stage**\n\n### 3.

{"id":"sitelink-95i","title":"Plan: Integrate sitelink-interpreter with mobile app and Cloudflare backend","description":"## Objective\nCreate an integration plan for connecting the sitelink-interpreter callout detection system with:\n1. Mobile app (Expo/React Native)\n2. Backend on Cloudflare Workers (using Cloudflare Containers)\n\n## Background Context\n\n### Current Solution Architecture\n\n**Callout Detection Pipeline** (packages/callout-processor-v5):\n- YOLO v6 model trained on 72 DPI images with SAHI tiling\n- Detects 3 callout classes: detail, elevation, title\n- Performance: 96.5%+ precision and recall\n\n**Text Extraction** (Gemini Flash 2 via OpenRouter):\n- Uses `--gemini` flag with `--hires-image` for high-resolution crops\n- YOLO detection runs on 72 DPI, but crops taken from 150 DPI original\n- Tight bbox crops (no padding) to avoid surrounding text confusion\n- Batched API calls (10 crops per request) for efficiency\n- Extracts identifier (detail number) and target_sheet (sheet reference)\n\n**Sheet Info Extraction** (extract_sheet_info_gemini.py):\n- Extracts sheet_number and sheet_title from title block region\n- Crops bottom-right 40% of page (where title blocks live)\n- Batched processing (10 pages per API call)\n- Returns both sheet_number (e.g., \"S2.0\") and sheet_title (e.g., \"FOUNDATION PLAN\")\n\n### Working Frontend Example\n\n**SiteLink Plan Explorer** (packages/sitelink-interpreter):\n- Browser-based UI at localhost:3456\n- Built with Bun + React (no Vite, uses Bun.serve with HTML imports)\n- Features:\n  - PDF upload with automatic sheet extraction\n  - Interactive canvas with callout bounding boxes\n  - Sheet sidebar showing sheet_number and sheet_title\n  - Provenance panel showing callout details and navigation\n  - Click-to-navigate between referenced sheets\n\n**Key Files to Reference**:\n- `src/api/server.ts` - Bun.serve API with all endpoints\n- `src/ui/explorer.tsx` - Main React UI component\n- `src/extraction/yolo-extraction.ts` - Detection pipeline integration\n- `src/ingestion/index.ts` - PDF ingestion with Gemini sheet info extraction\n\n### API Endpoints (Current)\n\n| Endpoint | Method | Description |\n|----------|--------|-------------|\n| `/api/upload` | POST | Upload PDF, run legacy extraction |\n| `/api/detect` | POST | Upload PDF, run YOLO + Gemini extraction |\n| `/api/sheets` | GET | List all sheets with sheet_number, sheet_title |\n| `/api/sheets/:id` | GET | Get single sheet details |\n| `/api/sheets/:id/entities` | GET | Get callouts for a sheet |\n| `/api/sheets/:id/detect` | POST | Run detection on single sheet |\n| `/api/entities/:id/provenance` | GET | Get callout provenance chain |\n\n## Cloudflare Container Requirements\n\n**Research Needed**: Cloudflare Containers (beta)\n- How to containerize the Python detection pipeline\n- GPU requirements for YOLO inference\n- Memory requirements for large PDFs\n- Cold start implications\n\n**Dependencies**:\n- Python 3.10+\n- OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow\n- Ultralytics YOLO\n- PaddleOCR (optional, fallback)\n- httpx (for OpenRouter API)\n\n**Model Files**:\n- YOLO weights: ~6MB (packages/callout-processor-v6-experimental/weights/best.pt)\n\n## Questions to Answer\n\n1. **Container Architecture**:\n   - Single container with Python + YOLO?\n   - Separate containers for detection vs text extraction?\n   - How to handle OPENROUTER_API_KEY secrets?\n\n2. **API Design**:\n   - How should mobile app call the detection service?\n   - Through Cloudflare backend proxy?\n   - WebSocket/SSE for progress updates during processing?\n\n3. **Data Flow**:\n   - PDFs uploaded to R2 storage?\n   - Detection results stored in D1 or LiveStore?\n   - How to serve callout crop images to mobile?\n\n4. **Sheet Info Integration**:\n   - How to surface sheet_number and sheet_title in mobile UI?\n   - How to link callouts to sheets for navigation?\n   - PMTiles integration for zoomable sheet viewing?\n\n5. **Local Development**:\n   - How to run containerized interpreter alongside wrangler dev?\n   - Docker Compose setup for local testing?\n   - How to test mobile → backend → container flow locally?\n\n## Deliverables\n\n1. Architecture diagram showing:\n   - Mobile app → Cloudflare Worker → Container → R2/D1\n   - Data flow for upload, detection, and retrieval\n\n2. API endpoint specifications for mobile consumption\n\n3. Data models/schema changes for LiveStore events\n\n4. Implementation tickets with dependencies:\n   - Containerize sitelink-interpreter\n   - Create Cloudflare Worker proxy endpoints\n   - Integrate detection results into mobile UI\n   - Add sheet navigation to mobile plan viewer\n\n## References\n\n- Commit 2bb7f9278: High-res Gemini extraction implementation\n- sitelink-i78: High-res Gemini extraction ticket (closed)\n- packages/callout-processor-v5/README.md: Detection documentation\n- packages/sitelink-interpreter/CLAUDE.md: Development conventions","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-26T01:35:54.788636002-05:00","created_by":"woodson","updated_at":"2026-01-26T01:38:38.44609444-05:00","labels":["backend"],"comments":[{"id":99,"issue_id":"sitelink-95i","author":"woodson","text":"## Research Starting Points\n\n**Cloudflare Containers Documentation**:\n- https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/ (when available)\n- Look for: pricing, GPU support, cold start times, memory limits\n\n**Existing Codebase Context**:\n- Backend: apps/backend/ (Cloudflare Workers with Hono)\n- Mobile: apps/mobile/ (Expo/React Native with LiveStore)\n- Domain events: packages/domain/src/events.ts\n- Materializers: packages/domain/src/materializers.ts\n\n**PMTiles Integration** (already implemented):\n- See apps/backend/container/ for existing tile generation\n- Uses pyvips for tile creation\n- Stores tiles in R2\n\n**Testing the Current Solution**:\n```bash\ncd packages/sitelink-interpreter\nbun run src/api/server.ts  # Starts on localhost:3456\n# Upload a PDF through the UI to see the full pipeline\n```","created_at":"2026-01-26T06:38:53Z"}]}

{"id":"sitelink-9jv","title":"Text Label Detection for Construction Plan Callouts","description":"Implement text detection solution to extract callout labels (e.g., '17/S2.0') from construction plans.\n\nProblem: YOLOv8n detects symbols (96.6% mAP50) but OCR returns empty strings (12% confidence) because text labels are positioned ADJACENT to symbols, not inside YOLO bounding boxes. Even with 150% padding expansion, text regions are missed.\n\nSolution Options (ranked):\n1.

{"id":"sitelink-bne","title":"Fix callout marker positioning: use normalized coordinates","description":"## Problem\n\nCallout markers are not positioned correctly on the plan viewer. They appear offset from the actual callout symbols.\n\n### Root Cause\n\nThe container's `detect_callouts_with_llm` function converts LLM-returned normalized coordinates (0-1) to absolute pixel coordinates at 300 DPI before storing them:\n\n```python\n# server.py lines 586-587\n\"x\": int(rel_x * width) if rel_x \u003c= 1 else int(rel_x),\n\"y\": int(rel_y * height) if rel_y \u003c= 1 else int(rel_y),\n```\n\nBut the viewer uses these pixel coordinates directly without accounting for the actual displayed image size, which may differ from the 300 DPI detection size.\n\n### Correct Approach (from backend-dev demo)\n\nThe demo stored **normalized (0-1) coordinates** and multiplied by actual tile image size at render time:\n\n```javascript\nconst imageSize = tiledImage.getContentSize();\nconst tilePixelX = h.x * imageSize.x;  // h.x is 0-1 normalized\nconst tilePixelY = h.y * imageSize.y;\n```\n\n## Solution\n\nStore normalized coordinates (0-1) in events instead of converting to pixels. Update all viewers to scale at render time.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Step 1: Update Container (server.py)\n\nFile: `apps/backend/container/server.py`\n\nIn `detect_callouts_with_llm` function (~line 576-590):\n\n**Before:**\n```python\nprocessed_markers.append({\n    \"id\": f\"marker-{sheet_id}-{i}-{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}\",\n    \"label\": marker.get('label', ''),\n    \"targetSheetRef\": marker.get('targetSheetRef'),\n    \"x\": int(rel_x * width) if rel_x \u003c= 1 else int(rel_x),\n    \"y\": int(rel_y * height) if rel_y \u003c= 1 else int(rel_y),\n    \"confidence\": marker.get('confidence', 0.5),\n    \"needsReview\": marker.get('needsReview', False)\n})\n```\n\n**After:**\n```python\nprocessed_markers.append({\n    \"id\": f\"marker-{sheet_id}-{i}-{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}\",\n    \"label\": marker.get('label', ''),\n    \"targetSheetRef\": marker.get('targetSheetRef'),\n    \"x\": float(rel_x) if rel_x \u003c= 1 else float(rel_x / width),  # Keep normalized 0-1\n    \"y\": float(rel_y) if rel_y \u003c= 1 else float(rel_y / height), # Keep normalized 0-1\n    \"confidence\": marker.get('confidence', 0.5),\n    \"needsReview\": marker.get('needsReview', False)\n})\n```\n\nAlso update CV fallback (~line 660-670) to return normalized coords:\n```python\nheight, width = img.shape[:2]  # Get dimensions\n# ...\nmarkers.append({\n    \"x\": float(x) / width,   # Normalize\n    \"y\": float(y) / height,  # Normalize\n    # ...\n})\n```\n\n### Step 2: Update Event Schema Documentation\n\nFile: `packages/domain/src/events.ts`\n\nAdd JSDoc comment to clarify coordinate system:\n\n```typescript\n// In sheetCalloutsDetected and sheetCalloutsUpdated schemas:\nx: Schema.Number,  // Normalized coordinate (0-1), multiply by image width to get pixels\ny: Schema.Number,  // Normalized coordinate (0-1), multiply by image height to get pixels\n```\n\n### Step 3: Update Backend Viewer\n\nFile: `apps/backend/viewer/src/components/PMTilesViewer.tsx`\n\nIn `addMarkerOverlays` callback (~line 26-70):\n\n**Before:**\n```typescript\nconst imageRect = new OpenSeadragon.Rect(\n  marker.x - overlayPixelSize / 2,\n  marker.y - overlayPixelSize / 2,\n  overlayPixelSize,\n  overlayPixelSize\n)\n```\n\n**After:**\n```typescript\nconst tiledImage = viewer.world.getItemAt(0)\nconst imageSize = tiledImage.getContentSize()\n\n// Convert normalized (0-1) to tile pixel coordinates\nconst tilePixelX = marker.x * imageSize.x\nconst tilePixelY = marker.y * imageSize.y\n\nconst imageRect = new OpenSeadragon.Rect(\n  tilePixelX - overlayPixelSize / 2,\n  tilePixelY - overlayPixelSize / 2,\n  overlayPixelSize,\n  overlayPixelSize\n)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Update Mobile Viewer (if applicable)\n\nFile: `apps/mobile/components/plans/viewer/openseadragon-viewer.tsx` (or similar)\n\nApply same coordinate transformation pattern if markers are rendered there.\n\n### Step 5: Migration Consideration\n\n**Important**: Existing marker data in the database uses pixel coordinates. Options:\n\nA) **Re-process existing plans** - Trigger callout detection again for existing sheets\nB) **Handle both formats** - Check if x/y \u003e 1, treat as legacy pixel coords and normalize using sheet dimensions\nC) **Clear and restart** - If in dev, clear existing data and re-upload PDFs\n\nRecommended: Option B for backwards compatibility:\n\n```typescript\n// In viewer, handle both formats:\nconst isNormalized = marker.x \u003c= 1 \u0026\u0026 marker.y \u003c= 1\nconst tilePixelX = isNormalized \n  ? marker.x * imageSize.x \n  : (marker.x / sheetWidth) * imageSize.x  // Legacy: normalize then scale\nconst tilePixelY = isNormalized\n  ? marker.y * imageSize.y\n  : (marker.y / sheetHeight) * imageSize.y\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Upload a fresh PDF and verify markers appear directly on callout symbols\n2. Zoom in/out and verify markers stay aligned\n3. Test with existing data (if keeping) to verify backwards compatibility\n4. Compare with backend-dev demo behavior\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n1. `apps/backend/container/server.py` - Store normalized coords\n2. `packages/domain/src/events.ts` - Add documentation comment\n3. `apps/backend/viewer/src/components/PMTilesViewer.tsx` - Scale at render\n4. `apps/mobile/components/plans/viewer/*.tsx` - Scale at render (if applicable)\n\n## References\n\n- OpenSeadragon integration doc: https://github.com/Woody88/sitelink/blob/backend-dev/packages/callout-processor/OPENSEADRAGON-INTEGRATION.md\n- Working demo: https://github.com/Woody88/sitelink/tree/backend-dev/packages/callout-processor/demo","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-13T17:24:14.173498362-05:00","created_by":"woodson","updated_at":"2026-01-13T17:31:31.237179567-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-13T17:31:31.237179567-05:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

Test results show significant improvement in detection quality.","comments":[{"id":31,"issue_id":"sitelink-sv4","author":"woodson","text":"## Analysis \u0026 Recommendations\n\n### Why Current Detection Works Well on Specific Plans\n\nThe v3 implementation succeeds on test plans because:\n\n1. **Plans follow PSPC standard** - The detection was tuned for PSPC callout symbols\n2. **Consistent DPI** - Plans rendered at 300 DPI match hardcoded parameters\n3. **Callout sizes in range** - Test plan callouts fall within 15-50px radius\n4. **Clean scans** - High-quality PDFs with clear line work\n\n### The Generalization Problem\n\n| Parameter | Current (Hardcoded) | Problem |\n|-----------|---------------------|---------|\n| Radius range | 15-50px @ 300 DPI | Different drawing scales have different callout sizes |\n| Detail labels | Numbers only (1, 2, 3) | US drawings often use letters (A, B, C) for details |\n| Sheet refs | 'A5', 'B2' format | US may use 'S-501', 'A2.1' formats |\n| DPI assumption | 300 DPI | Scanned plans may be 150-600 DPI |\n\n### Recommended Approach\n\n**1. Widen Detection, Filter Downstream (Not Dynamic Sizing)**\n\nDon't try to 'dynamically' determine the right radius - this is a chicken-and-egg problem. Instead:\n\n```\nDetection: Be PERMISSIVE (10-80px range)\n     ↓\nOCR: Extract text from ALL candidates\n     ↓\nPattern Match: Filter by callout text patterns\n     ↓\nLLM (edge cases only): Low confidence or ambiguous\n```\n\n**2. Tiered Validation Strategy**\n\n```\nCircle detected\n    ↓\nOCR extracts text\n    ↓\nText matches callout pattern? (regex)\n├─ YES + high OCR conf (\u003e0.9) → Accept immediately\n├─ YES + low OCR conf (\u003c0.9) → LLM validation\n└─ NO text but has triangles → LLM validation (may be obscured)\n```\n\nCost savings: 80-90% of callouts resolved by OCR alone, LLM only for 10-20% edge cases.\n\n**3. US Standard Support**\n\nAdd parallel validators:\n\n```python\n# PSPC (current)\nis_valid_detail_callout_label_pspc(text)  # Numbers only: 1, 2, 1/A5\n\n# US/NCS (new)\nis_valid_detail_callout_label_us(text)    # Letters allowed: A, B, A/S5.1, 1/A-201\n\n# Sheet reference patterns\nPSPC: r'^[A-Z]\\d+$'           # A5, B2\nUS:   r'^[A-Z][\\d.-]+$'       # A2.1, S-501, A-201\n```\n\n**4. Failure Mode Priority**\n\n| Priority | Failure | Impact | Solution |\n|----------|---------|--------|----------|\n| P0 | False negatives | Missing callouts = broken navigation | Widen detection |\n| P1 | Misclassification | Wrong type = confusing | Use triangle geometry |\n| P2 | False positives | Extra noise, user ignores | OCR pattern filtering |\n\n### Implementation Order\n\n1. Widen radius range (10-80px) - low risk change\n2. Add US label validators alongside PSPC\n3. Implement tiered OCR → LLM validation\n4. Add sheet reference format detection (PSPC vs US)\n\n### Files to Modify\n\n- `packages/callout-processor-v3/src/detect.py` - Main detection logic\n- Add `packages/callout-processor-v3/src/standards.py` - Standard-specific validators","created_at":"2026-01-18T22:47:08Z"},{"id":32,"issue_id":"sitelink-sv4","author":"woodson","text":"## Test Plans for Implementation\n\n**Canadian (PSPC):**\n`/home/woodson/Code/projects/sitelink/apps/4-Structural-Drawings - 4pages.pdf`\n\n**US (NCS):**\n`/home/woodson/Code/projects/sitelink/apps/RTA_DRAWRING_8_PAGE_PLAN.pdf`\n\nOutput debug images to `packages/callout-processor-v4/output/` for visual verification.","created_at":"2026-01-18T22:53:06Z"},{"id":33,"issue_id":"sitelink-sv4","author":"woodson","text":"## v4 Implementation Complete - Initial Test Results\n\n### Files Created\n- `packages/callout-processor-v4/src/standards.py` - PSPC and NCS validators\n- `packages/callout-processor-v4/src/detect.py` - Main detection with widened parameters\n\n### Key Changes from v3\n1. **Widened radius range**: 10-80px (was 22-45px) - more permissive detection\n2. **Multi-standard support**: PSPC (Canadian) and NCS (US) validators\n3. **Tiered validation**: OCR-first with confidence scoring\n4. **Better debug output**: Confidence scores, standard detection\n\n### Test Results\n\n**US Plan (RTA_DRAWRING_8_PAGE_PLAN.pdf) @ 300 DPI:**\n- 8 pages processed\n- Total callouts: 193 (1 section cut, 152 details, 27 elevations, 11 sections, 4 titles)\n- Successfully detected PSPC-style refs: '3/S49', '8/Z4', '4/C5'\n- Issue: Many false positives (single letters like 'O', 'S', 'C')\n\n**Canadian Plan (4-Structural-Drawings.pdf) @ 150 DPI:**\n- 4 pages processed (7200x5400px each)\n- Total callouts: 117 (8 section cuts, 70 details, 1 elevation, 10 sections, 28 titles)\n\n### Observations\n\n1. **Widened detection catches more but needs better filtering**\n   - Finding 2636 circles on US sheet 0, only 34 pass validation\n   - Many single letters still getting through as 'detail' callouts\n\n2. **US plans have different patterns**\n   - More varied sheet reference formats\n   - Letters used for details (valid in NCS but causing false positives)\n\n3. **Title callouts detected but may have false positives**\n   - Need to review the annotated PNGs to verify\n\n### Output Location\n`packages/callout-processor-v4/output/`\n- `us/` - US plan results (8 sheets with annotated.png)\n- `canadian/` - Canadian plan results (4 sheets with annotated.png)\n\n### Next Steps\n1.

Training From Scratch Hurts Recall\n\n**Iteration 1 at epoch 88:**\n- Precision: 89.6% (good)\n- Recall: 60.8% (WORSE than 75.3% baseline) ⚠️\n\nModel learns to be too conservative when starting from scratch.\n\n---\n\n## WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED\n\n### ✅ Phase 1: Environment Setup\n- Copied v5 → v6-experimental\n- Created active_learning directory structure\n- Merged two datasets into dataset_combined\n- Created all necessary scripts\n\n### ✅ Phase 2: Baseline Validation (Iteration 0)\n- Validated v5 model on full dataset: 84.7% F1\n- Fixed validation script to handle mixed label formats\n- Generated error analysis: 686 FNs, 36 zero-detection images\n- Extracted 30 hard examples for active learning\n\n### ✅ Phase 3: Iteration 1 Training\n- Training YOLO-26-nano from scratch\n- 150 epochs, 2048px images, batch size 2\n- Currently at epoch 88/150 (59% complete)\n- Losses decreasing steadily\n- ETA: 2-3 hours remaining\n\n### ⚠️ Phase 4: Recall Issue Identified\n- Recall dropped from 75.3% → 60.8%\n- Root cause: Training from scratch vs fine-tuning\n- Solution ready: Switch to fine-tuning for iteration 2\n\n---\n\n## COMPLETE REPRODUCTION GUIDE\n\n### Step 1: Dataset Preparation\n\n```bash\ncd /home/woodson/Code/projects/sitelink/packages/callout-processor-v6-experimental\n\n# Extract zip files\nmkdir -p dataset_temp/v6 dataset_temp/v5\nunzip -q /home/woodson/Code/projects/sitelink/packages/callout-processor-v5/callout-detection.v6i.yolo26.zip -d dataset_temp/v6\nunzip -q /home/woodson/Code/projects/sitelink/packages/callout-processor-v5/callout-detection-2.v5i.yolo26.zip -d dataset_temp/v5\n\n# Merge datasets (Python script in sitelink-160 comments)\npython merge_datasets.py\n\n# Verify\ncat dataset_combined/train/labels/*.txt | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c\n# Should show: 939 detail (0), 927 elevation (1), 729 title (2)\n```\n\n### Step 2: Baseline Validation\n\n```bash\ncd active_learning\n\n# Validate v5 baseline\npython scripts/batch_validate.py \\\n  iterations/iteration_0_baseline/weights/best.pt \\\n  ../dataset_combined \\\n  --output metrics \\\n  --iteration 0 \\\n  --conf 0.25\n\n# Expected: F1 84.7%, Recall 75.3%\n```\n\n### Step 3: Error Analysis\n\n```bash\npython scripts/batch_error_analysis.py \\\n  --validation-report metrics/iteration_0/validation_report.json \\\n  --output-dir error_analysis/iteration_0 \\\n  --max-samples 30\n```\n\n### Step 4: Start Iteration 1 Training\n\n```bash\n# Training from scratch (NOTE: This causes recall drop!)\npython scripts/train_active_learning.py \\\n  --iteration 0 \\\n  --data ../dataset_combined/data.yaml \\\n  --output-dir iterations/iteration_1_yolo26 \\\n  2\u003e\u00261 | tee /tmp/train_iter1_yolo.log \u0026\n\n# Monitor\ntail -f /tmp/train_iter1_yolo.log\n```\n\n### Step 5: Validate Iteration 1 (After Training)\n\n```bash\npython scripts/batch_validate.py \\\n  iterations/iteration_1_yolo26/weights/best.pt \\\n  ../dataset_combined \\\n  --output metrics \\\n  --iteration 1 \\\n  --conf 0.25\n```\n\n---\n\n## DECISION TREE FOR ITERATION 2\n\n### If Iteration 1 Recall \u003e70%\nContinue with current approach:\n```bash\npython scripts/train_active_learning.py \\\n  --iteration 1 \\\n  --data ../dataset_combined/data.yaml \\\n  --continue-from iterations/iteration_1_yolo26/weights/best.pt\n```\n\n### If Iteration 1 Recall \u003c70% (RECOMMENDED)\nSwitch to fine-tuning from baseline:\n```bash\npython scripts/train_active_learning.py \\\n  --iteration 0 \\\n  --data ../dataset_combined/data.yaml \\\n  --output-dir iterations/iteration_2_finetune \\\n  --continue-from iterations/iteration_0_baseline/weights/best.pt\n\n# Adjust epochs: Edit train_active_learning.py\n# BASELINE_CONFIG['epochs'] = 50  # Reduce from 150\n```\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Starts with 75.3% recall (baseline)\n- Learns from more data (2,529 vs whatever v5 had)\n- Should reach 80-85% recall\n- Preserves existing knowledge\n\n---\n\n## KEY FILES REFERENCE\n\n**Dataset:**\n- /home/woodson/Code/projects/sitelink/packages/callout-processor-v6-experimental/dataset_combined\n\n**Weights:**\n- Baseline (v5): iterations/iteration_0_baseline/weights/best.pt\n- Iteration 1: iterations/iteration_1_yolo26/weights/best.pt (in progress)\n\n**Scripts:**\n- Training: active_learning/scripts/train_active_learning.py\n- Validation: active_learning/scripts/batch_validate.py\n- Error analysis: active_learning/scripts/batch_error_analysis.py\n- Convergence: active_learning/scripts/convergence_tracker.py\n\n**Metrics:**\n- Convergence CSV: active_learning/metrics/convergence_tracking.csv\n- Validation reports: active_learning/metrics/iteration_N/\n- Error reports: active_learning/error_analysis/iteration_N/\n\n**Logs:**\n- Training: /tmp/train_iter1_yolo.log\n\n---\n\n## PAIN POINTS SOLVED\n\n1. ✅ Dataset merge issue (two zip files)\n2. ✅ Mixed label format (bbox + polygon)\n3. ✅ YOLOE-26n doesn't exist (used YOLO-26n instead)\n4. ✅ Validation script couldn't parse polygons\n5. ✅ Monitor script can't handle ANSI codes\n6. ⚠️ Recall drop from training from scratch (solution ready)\n\n---\n\n## FINAL RECOMMENDATION\n\n**User Decision:** Let iteration 1 finish, then:\n1. If recall \u003e70%: Continue with iteration 2\n2. If recall \u003c70%: Switch to fine-tuning approach\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\n- Iteration 2 (fine-tuned): 80-85% recall, 95%+ precision, 88-92% F1\n- Iteration 3 (with hard examples): 90-95% F1\n- Final target: 98% F1\n\n**Time Estimate:**\n- Iteration 1: 2-3 hours remaining\n- Iteration 2: 2-4 hours (50-100 epochs)\n- Iteration 3: 2-4 hours (if needed)\n- Total: 6-11 hours from now\n\n---\n\n## VISUALIZATION\n\nCreated visualization of all 939 detail callouts:\n- Grid (100 samples): /tmp/detail_callouts_visualization/detail_callouts_grid_100.jpg\n- Grid (400 samples): /tmp/detail_callouts_visualization/detail_callouts_grid_full.jpg\n- Individual crops: /tmp/detail_callouts_visualization/detail_*.jpg\n\nUser confirmed all annotations look correct.

Detail callouts (circles only, no triangles) - identifiers are NUMBERS only (1-99)\n2. Elevation callouts (circles with 1 triangle on top) - can be NUMBER or SINGLE LETTER\n3. Section callouts (circles with 2+ triangles on sides/top) - SINGLE LETTERS A-Z for section IDs\n4. Title callouts (special circles in lower sheet area with horizontal line extending right + title text) - NUMBER or LETTER\n5. Section cut markers (triangle-first strategy for legacy section indicators)\n\nDETECTION APPROACH:\n- TWO-PHASE hybrid strategy:\n  a) CIRCLE-FIRST: Uses cv2.HoughCircles to find circle candidates (min_radius=22, max_radius=45 at 300 DPI)\n  b) TRIANGLE DETECTION: Uses adaptive threshold + contour approximation to find small filled triangles (area 30-600px²) attached to circles\n  c) CLASSIFICATION: Based on triangle count/position (0 tris=detail, 1 top=elevation, 2+ sides=section)\n  d) OCR VALIDATION: Uses PaddleOCR to extract text from inside circles; validates against strict regex patterns\n\nKEY HEURISTICS:\n- Circularity check (\u003e0.85) to filter non-circle shapes\n- Interior density check (\u003e75% white inside) to detect callout circles vs filled shapes\n- Horizontal line detection inside circles (using HoughLinesP) to distinguish title callouts\n- Triangle position classification (top=elevation, left/right=section, no triangle=detail)\n- Context validation: Detail circles must contain NUMBERS only; elevation/section can be letters\n\nLIMITATIONS \u0026 ISSUES:\n1. FALSE POSITIVES: Detects letters in words (e.g., 'O' in 'ROOF') as elevation callouts - partially mitigated by checking text on both sides of circle\n2. SMALL TRIANGLES NEAR TEXT: Struggles with legible text circles that have nearby triangles\n3. LABEL VALIDATION AGGRESSIVE: Rejects 72 invalid labels on sheet 6 (97 circles found, only 24 valid), suggesting high false positive rate on text-heavy sheets\n4. TITLE CALLOUT DETECTION LIMITED: Check_is_title_callout() requires circle in bottom 55% of sheet - misses centered/upper title callouts\n5. OCR CONFIDENCE THRESHOLD: Uses 0.4 confidence minimum - may misread similar characters (1 vs I, O vs 0)\n6. TRIANGLE SIZE RANGE FIXED: Hard-coded min/max area may miss scaled PDFs; uses scale factor but still brittle\n7. NO CONTEXT FROM SURROUNDING DRAWING: Pure image-based, ignores CAD structure\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n- Per-sheet marker JSON with normalized (x,y) coordinates + pixel coords + bounding box + confidence\n- Marker fields: id, label (OCR text), type (detail/elevation/section/title), identifier (parsed label), radius, triangleCount, trianglePositions\n- Summary JSON with sheet-level statistics and debug metrics\n- Annotated PNG visualization showing detected callouts with color coding\n- debug info tracks: circles_found, candidates_processed, valid_labels, invalid_labels\n\nDEPENDENCIES:\n- cv2 (OpenCV): HoughCircles, HoughLinesP, contour detection, morphological ops\n- fitz/PyMuPDF: PDF rendering to image at configurable DPI\n- paddleocr (PaddleOCR): Text extraction with angle classification\n- numpy: Image processing operations","created_at":"2026-01-17T19:58:08Z"},{"id":21,"issue_id":"sitelink-x0w","author":"woodson","text":"PSPC STANDARD SUMMARY: Symbol definitions - Detail callouts use circles with numbers (1-99), Elevation callouts use circles with 1 triangle on top (number or letter), Section callouts use circles with 2+ triangles (A-Z letters), Title callouts have horizontal lines extending right with scale notation.

Both detail callouts AND dimension circles have text inside\n2. OCR cannot distinguish semantic meaning (\"D2 A-512\" vs \"12'-6\\\")\n3.
