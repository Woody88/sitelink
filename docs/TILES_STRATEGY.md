Excellent question! Based on my research into document retention best practices and construction industry requirements, you should absolutely keep the original multi-page PDF. Let me explain why the benefits vastly outweigh the minimal storage cost.
The Storage Cost Reality
Let me walk you through the actual storage implications so you can see why this is a no-brainer decision. Imagine a typical construction plan set with 25 pages:
Your original PDF is likely around 30-80 MB depending on how it was created. This is actually highly compressed because PDFs are efficient at storing vector graphics and text. Each of your single-page PDFs will total about the same as the original (maybe 2-4 MB each × 25 pages = 50-100 MB). When you convert each page to a high-resolution PNG image suitable for tiling, you're looking at maybe 8-15 MB per image × 25 = 200-375 MB. The DZI tile pyramids for all sheets could easily be 3-8 GB depending on the resolution and zoom levels you generate.
So your total storage for one plan set would be approximately 30-80 MB for the original PDF plus 50-100 MB for single-page PDFs plus 200-375 MB for images plus 3-8 GB for tiles, totaling roughly 3.3-8.5 GB. The original PDF represents only about one to two percent of your total storage. On Cloudflare R2 at current pricing (roughly $0.015 per GB per month), that 50 MB original PDF costs you less than a tenth of a penny per month. The decision to keep or delete it has essentially zero impact on your storage costs.
Legal and Compliance Requirements Are Significant
Here's where things get really important for your construction SaaS business. The construction industry has strict document retention requirements that you need to understand. Construction project documentation like drawings, specifications, and calculations should be kept for at least three years after the statute of repose ends, and statutes of repose in different states range from four to twenty years after project completion PBMares. This means in some jurisdictions, construction documents need to be retained for up to 23 years.
Your construction company customers face serious legal exposure if they can't produce original project documents during disputes or audits. Engineering and architecture firms should maintain project agreements, feasibility studies, drawings, and design calculations permanently or at least as long as the applicable statute of repose Freeman Law. When your customers upload their plan sets to your platform, they're likely relying on you as part of their document retention strategy. If you delete the original PDFs and they later need them for a lawsuit or regulatory audit, you've created a significant problem for them and potentially exposed yourself to liability.
There's an additional technical consideration here that matters. Drawings and specifications should be evaluated for retention in physical format because electronic data may become difficult to access when the programs or software used to create the documents become outdated Freeman Law. The PDF format is an ISO standard that's specifically designed for long-term archiving. Your PNG images and JPEG tiles might work fine today, but twenty years from now, the PDF is more likely to remain accessible and viewable than proprietary image formats or your custom tile structure.
The Original PDF Has Unique Value
Beyond legal requirements, the original PDF contains information that gets lost in your processing pipeline. Construction PDFs often include embedded metadata about who created the drawings, when they were revised, what software was used, and approval signatures or stamps. When you extract pages to images, all of that metadata disappears. If a construction worker needs to verify whether they're looking at the latest revision of Sheet A-3, or needs to contact the engineer who signed off on a particular detail, that information might only exist in the original PDF's metadata.
Additionally, construction PDFs are typically created from CAD software and contain vector graphics, not just raster images. Text in these PDFs is searchable and selectable. When you convert to PNG or JPEG, that text becomes just pixels and you lose the ability to search for specific annotations, dimensions, or notes unless you implement OCR, which is never perfect. Your users might actually want to download and work with the original PDF using their own tools.
Your Processing Chain Benefits From Having the Source
Think about your disaster recovery strategy. Your current workflow creates multiple derived files from the original PDF - single-page PDFs, then images, then tiles. At each conversion step, you're potentially introducing quality loss (especially when going to JPEG tiles) and definitely creating dependencies. If something goes wrong with your tile generation or if you want to regenerate tiles at higher resolution in the future or with different settings, having the original PDF means you can reprocess from the authoritative source.
Imagine this scenario: A year from now you discover that your image extraction process had a bug that slightly rotated some pages, or you decide you want to increase tile resolution for better zoom quality, or OpenSeadragon releases a new version that works better with different tile overlap settings. If you kept the original PDF, you can reprocess everything cleanly. If you deleted it, you're stuck regenerating from images that might already have quality issues, and you've lost the ability to go back to the perfect source.
Recommended Storage Strategy
Here's what I'd suggest for your folder structure, keeping the original PDF:
storage/
├── organizations/
│   └── {org-id}/
│       ├── projects/
│       │   └── {project-id}/
│       │       ├── uploads/
│       │       │   └── {upload-id}/
│       │       │       ├── original/
│       │       │       │   └── {upload-id}.pdf          # KEEP THIS
│       │       │       └── metadata.json
│       │       └── sheets/
│       │           └── {sheet-id}/
│       │               ├── source/
│       │               │   ├── {sheet-id}.pdf           # Single-page PDF (optional)
│       │               │   └── {sheet-id}.png           # Extracted image
│       │               ├── tiles/
│       │               │   ├── {sheet-id}.dzi
│       │               │   └── {sheet-id}_files/
│       │               └── metadata.json
Now, regarding your single-page PDFs - this is where you actually have a legitimate choice. Since you're extracting images directly from these single-page PDFs and never using them again, you could consider treating them as truly temporary intermediate files that you delete after image extraction succeeds. The storage math here is different because single-page PDFs collectively take up significant space (roughly equal to the original), and they're purely intermediate artifacts with no long-term value if you have both the original multi-page PDF and the extracted images.
Your workflow could be: Keep the original multi-page PDF permanently in the uploads folder. Generate a single-page PDF as a temporary working file (maybe in a temp directory or even just in memory if your PDF processing library supports it). Extract the image from that single-page PDF. Delete the single-page PDF once the image extraction succeeds and is verified. Keep the image and use it for tile generation.
This approach gives you the best of both worlds. You keep the authoritative original source (the multi-page PDF) for legal compliance, disaster recovery, and user value. You eliminate the intermediate single-page PDFs that serve no long-term purpose. And you keep the images which are necessary for tile generation and represent your checkpoint between extraction and tiling.
The Bottom Line
Keep the original multi-page PDF without question. The storage cost is negligible, the legal and compliance requirements are real, the business value is significant, and your disaster recovery capabilities depend on it. Consider deleting only the single-page PDFs after extracting images, since those are truly intermediate files with no long-term value. Your users are trusting you with their construction documents, and those documents might need to be retained for decades. Don't optimize away a couple megabytes at the cost of potentially serious problems down the road.
Does this help clarify the decision? The original PDF is like keeping the source code in a software project - you never want to delete your source even if the compiled output is what users actually run.
