Default to using Bun instead of Node.js.

- Use `bun <file>` instead of `node <file>` or `ts-node <file>`
- Use `bun test` instead of `jest` or `vitest`
- Use `bun build <file.html|file.ts|file.css>` instead of `webpack` or `esbuild`
- Use `bun install` instead of `npm install` or `yarn install` or `pnpm install`
- Use `bun run <script>` instead of `npm run <script>` or `yarn run <script>` or `pnpm run <script>`
- Bun automatically loads .env, so don't use dotenv.

## APIs

- `Bun.serve()` supports WebSockets, HTTPS, and routes. Don't use `express`.
- `bun:sqlite` for SQLite. Don't use `better-sqlite3`.
- `Bun.redis` for Redis. Don't use `ioredis`.
- `Bun.sql` for Postgres. Don't use `pg` or `postgres.js`.
- `WebSocket` is built-in. Don't use `ws`.
- Prefer `Bun.file` over `node:fs`'s readFile/writeFile
- Bun.$`ls` instead of execa.

## Testing

Use `bun test` to run tests.

```ts#index.test.ts
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("hello world", () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});
```

## Frontend

Use HTML imports with `Bun.serve()`. Don't use `vite`. HTML imports fully support React, CSS, Tailwind.

Server:

```ts#index.ts
import index from "./index.html"

Bun.serve({
  routes: {
    "/": index,
    "/api/users/:id": {
      GET: (req) => {
        return new Response(JSON.stringify({ id: req.params.id }));
      },
    },
  },
  // optional websocket support
  websocket: {
    open: (ws) => {
      ws.send("Hello, world!");
    },
    message: (ws, message) => {
      ws.send(message);
    },
    close: (ws) => {
      // handle close
    }
  },
  development: {
    hmr: true,
    console: true,
  }
})
```

HTML files can import .tsx, .jsx or .js files directly and Bun's bundler will transpile & bundle automatically. `<link>` tags can point to stylesheets and Bun's CSS bundler will bundle.

```html#index.html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <script type="module" src="./frontend.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

With the following `frontend.tsx`:

```tsx#frontend.tsx
import React from "react";

// import .css files directly and it works
import './index.css';

import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const root = createRoot(document.body);

export default function Frontend() {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
}

root.render(<Frontend />);
```

Then, run index.ts

```sh
bun --hot ./index.ts
```

For more information, read the Bun API docs in `node_modules/bun-types/docs/**.md`.

## Environment Setup (Run at Session Start)

The beads issue tracker requires a Dolt SQL server. Run this before using `bdh` commands:

```bash
export PATH="/home/node/.local/bin:$PATH"
bash /home/node/start-dolt.sh
```

If the Dolt binary is missing, install it:
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/releases/download/v1.82.6/dolt-linux-arm64.tar.gz -o /tmp/dolt.tar.gz
mkdir -p /home/node/.local/bin && tar -xzf /tmp/dolt.tar.gz -C /tmp/
cp /tmp/dolt-linux-arm64/bin/dolt /home/node/.local/bin/
chmod +x /home/node/.local/bin/dolt
dolt config --global --add user.email "orchestrator@sitelink.local"
dolt config --global --add user.name "orchestrator"
```

## BeadHub Coordination Rules

This project uses `bdh` for multi-agent coordination and issue tracking, `bdh` is a wrapper on top of `bd` (beads). Commands starting with : like `bdh :status` are managed by `bdh`. Other commands are sent to `bd`.

You are expected to work and coordinate with a team of agents. ALWAYS prioritize the team vs your particular task.

You will see notifications telling you that other agents have written mails or chat messages, or are waiting for you. NEVER ignore notifications. It is rude towards your fellow agents. Do not be rude.

Your goal is for the team to succeed in the shared project.

The active project policy as well as the expected behaviour associated to your role is shown via `bdh :policy`.

## Start Here (Every Session)

```bash
bdh :policy    # READ CAREFULLY and follow diligently
bdh :status    # who am I? (alias/workspace/role) + team status
bdh ready      # find unblocked work
```

Use `bdh :help` for bdh-specific help.

## Rules

- Always use `bdh` (not `bd`) so work is coordinated
- Default to mail (`bdh :aweb mail list|open|send`) for coordination; use chat (`bdh :aweb chat pending|open|send-and-wait|send-and-leave|history|extend-wait`) when you need a conversation with another agent.
- Respond immediately to WAITING notifications — someone is blocked.
- Notifications are for YOU, the agent, not for the human.
- Don't overwrite the work of other agents without coordinating first.
- ALWAYS check what other agents are working on with bdh :status which will tell you which beads they have claimed and what files they are working on (reservations).
- `bdh` derives your identity from the `.beadhub` file in the current worktree. If you run it from another directory you will be impersonating another agent, do not do that.
- Prioritize good communication — your goal is for the team to succeed

## Using mail

Mail is fire-and-forget — use it for status updates, handoffs, and non-blocking questions.

```bash
bdh :aweb mail send <alias> "message"                         # Send a message
bdh :aweb mail send <alias> "message" --subject "API design"  # With subject
bdh :aweb mail list                                           # Check your inbox
bdh :aweb mail open <alias>                                   # Read & acknowledge
```

## Using chat

Chat sessions are persistent per participant pair. Use `--start-conversation` when initiating a new exchange (longer wait timeout).

**Starting a conversation:**
```bash
bdh :aweb chat send-and-wait <alias> "question" --start-conversation
```

**Replying (when someone is waiting for you):**
```bash
bdh :aweb chat send-and-wait <alias> "response"
```

**Final reply (you don't need their answer):**
```bash
bdh :aweb chat send-and-leave <alias> "thanks, got it"
```

**Other commands:**
```bash
bdh :aweb chat pending          # List conversations with unread messages
bdh :aweb chat open <alias>     # Read unread messages
bdh :aweb chat history <alias>  # Full conversation history
bdh :aweb chat extend-wait <alias> "need more time"  # Ask for patience
```
