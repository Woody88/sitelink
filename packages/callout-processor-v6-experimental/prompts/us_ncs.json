      "text_prompt": "A small detail indicator symbol per NCS 01 42 00-020. MUST be a circle (or rectangle/hexagon) with a HORIZONTAL DIVIDING LINE through the middle. The horizontal line is the KEY DISTINGUISHING FEATURE. Symbol diameter/width is small and compact: 0.3-0.8 inches (20-60 pixels at 150 DPI). Inside the circle is a simple alphanumeric identifier (like '3', 'D2', '15') ABOVE the horizontal dividing line, with an optional sheet reference BELOW the line (format: 'A-201', 'S4.1', 'A-512'). CRITICAL: The symbol has NO TRIANGLES - if it has a triangle, it's an elevation callout, NOT a detail callout. The horizontal divider line separates the detail number from the sheet reference, appearing like a fraction. May have a thin leader line or arrow pointing to the detail location. Appears on plan views to reference enlarged details. Size constraint: bounding box should be compact (20-60 pixels width/height), NOT large text areas or dimension annotations.",

Two types exist: Type 1 is a solid triangle with text near its base showing detail number and sheet reference separated by '/'. Type 2 is a circle with a triangle attached where the triangle points stick out from the circle edge; inside the circle is a horizontal line with detail number above and sheet reference below (like a fraction). CRITICAL distinguishing feature: MUST have a visible solid triangle. If no triangle is present, it is NOT an elevation - it's a different callout type. The triangle is the key identifier. Compact size, not large areas. May have a thin leader line pointing to the elevation location. Format examples: '2/A-201', 'A4' over 'A-201'.",

Contains only a simple reference number (1-9) or letter (A-Z) that matches a detail callout on the main plan. The circle is thin-outlined, standalone, and compact. CRITICAL: This is NOT the large sheet title block with drawing name and sheet number - those are much larger rectangular areas. This is a tiny circle marker within individual detail enlargements.
